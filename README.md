# React Native Beautiful Timeline with Pressable Items
---
This is a simple React Native Timeline that I found on Github. It is just a FlatList that displays time. I modified it to be pressable so I can know what dates are being pressed. I forked this repo and edited it from there. This is used on my TimeBox Project.
